# Balloon Shooter Game 

Balloon shooter game that I made as my first ever programming project @ college in 2013.

* Developed with allegro game development library.
* Used Dev C++ as an IDE
* Code quality might be horrible (First ever project)
* This project introduced passion & hunger for programming to me 
* Free to use any way you can
* Special thanks to suresh & prashant for support
